    ```

    sylius_paypal:
        resource: "@SyliusPayPalPlugin/Resources/config/shop_routing.yaml"
        prefix: /{_locale}
        requirements:
            _locale: ^[A-Za-z]{2,4}(_([A-Za-z]{4}|[0-9]{3}))?(_([A-Za-z]{2}|[0-9]{3}))?$

   ```

3. Override Sylius' templates

    ```bash
    cp -R vendor/sylius/paypal-plugin/src/Resources/views/bundles/* templates/bundles/
    ```

4. Copy and apply migrations

   ```
   cp -R vendor/sylius/paypal-plugin/migrations/ src/Migrations/
   bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate -n
   ```

> BEWARE!

To make PayPal integration working, your local Sylius URL should be accessible for the PayPal servers. Therefore you can
add the proper directive to your `/etc/hosts` (something like `127.0.0.1 sylius.local`) or use a service as [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/).

## PayPal reports

To be able to download reports about your payouts, you need to have reports feature enabled on your PayPal account. Also,
it's required to configure SFTP account and set its data in `.env` file.

1. Log in to your PayPal account
2. Enter the profile settings

3. Pass to SFTP accounts panel

    ![panel](docs/reports-panel.png)

4. Create a new SFTP account

    ![accounts](docs/reports-accounts.png)

5. Configure username and password in payment method's configuration

## Processing payments

Plugin provides `sylius:pay-pal-plugin:complete-payments` command, that should be configured as cron job on the server.
It iterates over processing PayPal payments and completes them if the order is completed in PayPal.
